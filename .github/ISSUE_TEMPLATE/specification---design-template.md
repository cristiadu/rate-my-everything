**Motivation**
As a _TypeOfUser_, I want to _beAbleToSomething_, so that I _getSomethingFromTheSystem_.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] _featureName_ specification defined on a Wiki page within the project.
- [ ] Design prototype implemented for the given product specifications.
- [ ] After design is good, create Tech Design for the feature, adding new issues for each separate technical task associating each issue with this one.
